pytest-spec
===========
pytest plugin to display test execution output like a SPECIFICATION.


Available features
==================
* Format output to look like specification.
* Group tests by classes and files
* Failed, passed and skipped are marked and colored.
* Remove test\_ and underscores for every test.
* If the docstring is written for a test function, use it instead of converted test name (`--spec-docstr`).
